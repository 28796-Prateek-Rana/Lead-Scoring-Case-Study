When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. The company has a conversion rate of 30% and wish to make this process efficient by identifying the more potentially convertible leads or 'Hot Leads'.
